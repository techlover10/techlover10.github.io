        <h1> What is Cards Against OCaml? </h1>

        <p>Cards Against Humanity: In OCaml. Need I say anymore?</p>

        <p><em>Cards Against Humanity</em> is a card game (based on the popular family card game “Apples to Apples”) that pushes the bounds of friendship and political correctness through the incorrect and explicit juxtaposition of frankly unrelated objects in a very unusual (and often obscene) context. In other words, Cards Against Humanity is the game you don’t want your mother to know you play.</p>

        <p><em>Cards Against OCaml </em> is a multiplayer, server-client implementation of the popular card game Cards Against Humanity. Written in November of 2015 as the final project for CS 3110 at Cornell University, Cards Against OCaml was a team effort representing the result of several weeks of design, implementation, and testing.</p>
