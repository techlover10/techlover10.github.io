  <p style="padding:10px; padding-bottom:50px"> Since 2012, I have run a small business/side project selling custom instrumental theme music on Fiverr.com.  Shortly after I began offering the service, many people requested vocals- in response, I expanded my offerings to include jingles with rap lyrics.  Since then, I've made more than 50 sales, achieved Fiverr's Level 2 status, and maintained near-perfect reviews.  Some examples of my work are embedded below, and more samples of my past work can be heard on my gig's page <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/swaggernaut812/make-you-a-theme-song">here</a>, or on my project's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/swaggernaut812music">YouTube page</a>.
